Maslow argues that the role of his heirarchical model is primarily concerned with aesthetic, primarily as the one need beyond all others. I agree with him. The role of culture and the creative approach we employ in developing not just great systems and applications, but beautiful systems, and sophisticated expressions of these applications needs a platform that is exempt from the traditional culture of computer science. Our work is a collective endeavor to create a platform which can be utilized to host hypermedia content, We do not fancy ourselves software engineers yet, but we are certainly designing and building components that with some time and help from a community could culminate in a platform that is optimal for addressing the culture of programmers and software engineers by curating tools for content hosting, while offering them a platform for community that is uniquely biased towards creative expression, and favors emotion over logical reasoning, and disregards the status quo for the sake of finding ideas that are state of the art, challenging, and yet revolutionary; We invite you to make noise within our platform, get weird and avant-garde; We are not doing this without purpose; we believe the confluence of these freedoms promotes non-standard approaches to communication and creative expression often exiled from the rigerous process of analytical systems engineering.
